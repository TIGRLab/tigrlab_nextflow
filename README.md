TIGR PURR: TIGRLab Pipelines for Utterly Reproducible Research


TIGR-PURR is a pipeline system based off a combination of Nextflow and Boutiques which allow us to seamlessly run a variety of BIDS Applications based distributed pipelines easily with only a little bit of configuration work. The system will allow you to run full BIDS-app pipelines on:

The local Kimel-Lab Cluster
CAMH’s SCC Cluster
Scinet’s Niagara Cluster
Your local computer
To learn about how you can run BIDS pipelines on any BIDS dataset go to https://tigrlab-nextflow-personal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
